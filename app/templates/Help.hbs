              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Important Notice: </strong>The download of multiple datasets (e.g. for time-series) does not work using Internet Explorer, since this browser stops its work after the first file is downloaded. This seems to be a design feature.  It is, therefore, strongly recommended to use one of the following browsers: Firefox, Chromium, Safari.</p>
              <p>If you want to integrate the offered OGC interfaces into your GIS (or a similar application) and/or to automate the access to the offered CryoLand dataset, then please read the sections "Integration and Automation".</p>

              <h4>Using the Map Interface</h4>
              <p>The CryoService's Interactive Map interface is split into three sections. <br>
                </p><ul>
                  <li>The top:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a "Menu Bar" is located, allowing to choose one of the major functionalities:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Layer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opens a widget to select the Products, as well as Overlays and the Base layers (Background map) to be displayed</li>
                    <li>Legend:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opens a widget to display the legends associated with the respective Products</li>
                    <li>Download:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opens a widget to select the AOI and TOI and to initiate the download of the selected Products</li>
                    <li>Help:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opens a widget displaying this information</li>
                    <br>
                  </ul>
                  By clicking on a "Menu Bar" entry a widget will pop-up on the left side of the "Interactive Map" area, providing the respective functionalities. A widget can be closed again by either clicking the "x-symbol" located at the top-right of the widget or by clicking on another "Menu Bar" entry, which allows you to switch to the chosen widget immediately.
                  <br>&nbsp;<br>
                  <li>The middle:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the "Interactive Map" display:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Panning/Navigation:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;click on the map and drag the map as needed</li>
                    <li>Zoom-In:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double click or use Mouse-Wheel; alternatively - press and hold shift-button and then click-and-drag to draw a rectangle indicating the iapproximate new view area </li>
                    <li>Zoom-Out:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use Mouse-Wheel</li>
                    <br>
                  </ul>
                  <li>The bottom:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the "Time-Slider", to choose the date for viewing</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Allows to select the date for which Products shall be displayed</li>
                    <li>The Time-Slider can be simply dragged with the mouse toward left and right</li>
                    <li>The bright zone in the middle of the Time-Slider defines the date to be viewed</li>
                    <li>Provides indicators for which dates Products are available (color-coded according to the Products selected in the "Layer" widget)</li>
                   <li>The current coordinates of the mouse pointer are shown at the lower right corner</li>
                    <br>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              <p></p>

              <h4>Layer widget</h4>
              <p>
                The Layer widget provides access to the Product layers, Overlays and Base layers (Background map) to be displayed.<br> 
                The Layer widget allows to:
                </p><ul>
                  <li>select the Product layer(s) to be viewed - use the the check-box on the left (multiple selections possible)</li>
                  <li>arrange the order of the Product layers - click the "arrow-symbols" (up/down) located just left of the respective Product name</li>
                  <li>adapt the opacity of each Product layer - click the "black &amp; white circle symbol" which opens a slider widget which lets you define the opacity for the respective layer. Click the symbol again to close the slider widget</li>
                  <li>select Overlays to be displayed - use the selection boxes to select which Overlay masks to be applied (multiple selections possible). The masks are derived from CORINE and GLOBCOV datasets.</li>
                  <li>select the Base layer to be displayed - use the radio-buttons to select the background map to be applied (single selection only)</li>
                </ul>
              <p></p>

              <h4>Legend widget</h4>
              <p>The Layer widget provides access to the Legend associated with each CryoLand Product.<br>
              The Legend widget presents a "Common to all CryoLand Products" section at the top. Below this section a list of the available Products are presented. Each entry can be selected (by clicking it), which will then present the Legend specific for the respective Product. In cases where no Legend is associated with the respective Product a  "N/A"  (not available) will be displayed.
              </p>

              <h4>Download widget</h4>
              <p>
                The Download widget provides the possibility to select:
                </p><ul>
                  <li>the Area-of-Interest (AOI)</li>
                  <li>the Time-of-Interest (TOI)</li>
                </ul>
                for which the selected Product(s) shall be downloaded, and a "Download" button to initiate the download.
              <p></p>

              <p>
                <strong>Define the TOI - </strong>The TOI can be defined in the "Date Range" section, using one of the following methods:  
                </p><ul>
                  <li>click on the "calendar symbol" at the right side of the respective date fields (Start &amp; End)</li>
                  <li>enter the dates into the respective fields (Start &amp; End)</li>
                </ul>
              <p></p>

              <p>
                <strong>Define the AOI - </strong>The AOI can be defined using one of the following methods:
                </p><ul>
                  <li>Define a rectangular Bounding Box</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>press the "Draw Bounding Box" button and then click-and drag the mouse to draw a rectangle in the "Interactive Map" area. The selected coordinates will be provided in the corresponding widget fields (MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY). These fields also allow a later correction of the coordinates. </li>
                    <li>enter the desired coordinates into the corresponding widget fields (MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY). After entering the last number the rectangle will be drawn in the "Interactive Map" area.</li>
                    <br>
                  </ul>
                  To remove a rectangle from the "Interactive Map" area, click on the "x-symbol" button at the right of the "Draw Bounding Box" button.<br>&nbsp;<br>

                  <li>Upload a shp-file (optionally including the associated dbf-file). <u>Only closed polygons with Lat/Lon (WGS84) coordinates are supported</u>.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>pressing the "Select file" button, will provide you with your local file-manager allowing you select the shp-file you want to submit (plus optionally the dbf-file using multi-select) for uploading. <br>
                    Once a file has been submitted, the "Select file" button will be named "Change" button, to indicate that a file has already been selected. Nevertheless, the functionality of the button stays the same.</li>
                    <li>pressing the "Select Polygon" button will provide with a pop-up widget allowing the selection of one of provided polygons (in case multiple polygons are contained in the shp-file).<br>
                    Once a polygon has been selected it will be drawn onto the "Interactive Map" area. In addition the surrounding Bounding Box for the respective polygon is calculated and drawn and the coordinates are provided in the Bounding Box fields (MinX, MinY, MaxX, MaxY). To remove a polygon and the associated Bounding Box, click on the "x-symbol" button at the right of the "Select Polygon" button.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                <strong>Initiate the Download - </strong>
                Once AOI and TOI are defined the download can be initiated by pressing the Download button. This will trigger the pop-up of the "Start Download" widget, which allows the detailed selection of the Products available for the specified AOI and TOI by clicking the respective check boxes (on the left of each Product name). The widget further provides access to additional information on the exact time period of each Product (when moving the mouse over the "i-symbol" located to the right of each Product name) and allows to specify the output file format and the desired output CRS for the Products to be downloaded. These two choices can be selected using the selection boxes at the bottom of the widget. The button "Select All" and "Invert Selection" work as the name suggests. Finally the "Start Download" button will start the download process and a local file manager window will appear asking for the location where the file(s) to be downloaded shall be saved. Unfortunately web Browsers will ask this for each and every file to be saved.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Important Notice: </strong>Internet Explorer will stop after the first download (seems to be a design feature), therefore access to time-series datasets will not be possible. It is, therefore, strongly recommended to use Firefox, Chromium or Safari, which will ask for the storage location also when multiple files are downloaded (e.g time-series dataset).
              </p>
              <p>
                In case there are no selected Products pressing the "Start Download" button will perform no action. To close the "Start Download" widget either click on the "x-symbol" (top right) or anywhere on the "Interactive Map" area.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you need to perform time-series request on a regular basis, we recommend that you consider the automation of EO-WCS request. For further information about EO-WCS requests, please read the chapter about "Integration and Automation". 
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Principle of operation of the shp-upload - </strong>The uploaded shp-file will be analyzed and its surrounding Bounding Box will be calculated. A Mask (with zero values) covering the outside of the polygon will be created. The datasets will then be requested and the mask is applied. The resulting images are delivered to the customer. This functionality works for single datasets as well as for multiple datasets (e.g. time-series) and is applied to any product selected in in the Layers widget. This functionality is intended e.g. for extracting a coverage or even a time-series of a drainage basin/catchment area/watershed or similar scenarios. This feature is not a part of the OGC WCS 2.0/EO-WCS standard, but is an additional implementation of EOxServer which is underlying the CryoLand services. The respective requests are implemented as HTTP POST requests.

              <h4>Integration into GIS</h4>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, so far we are not aware on any implementation which allow accessing an OGC WCS interface from within a GIS application.
              </p>
              
              <h4>Automation using scripting</h4>
              <p>
                Below you can download three example scripts which demonstrate the automated access to the OGC EO-WCS interface provided by the CryoLand GeoPortal. <br>
                All three scripts have been developed and tested under Linux/Unix OS, but should also run under Windows (although there maybe some minor modifications needed). <br>
                Further information about their "Usage" can be found inside the scripts.<br>
                These scripts are provided for your convenience "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind. Therefore, use them at your own risk. See also the Disclaimer inside the scripts.<br>
